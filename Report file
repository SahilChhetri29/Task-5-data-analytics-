# **Titanic Survival Analysis Report**  
 ## **1. Introduction**  
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, building upon foundational EDA while introducing deeper insights, refined visualizations, and actionable conclusions. We examine survival patterns through statistical, demographic, and socioeconomic lenses.

## **2. Dataset Overview**  
### **Basic Structure**  
- **Total Passengers:** 891  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Numerical:** Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch  
  - **Categorical:** Survived, Pclass, Sex, Embarked  
- **Missing Data:**  
  - **Age:** 177 missing (20%)  
  - **Cabin:** 687 missing (77%) *→ Excluded from analysis*  
  - **Embarked:** 2 missing (imputed with mode 'S')  

### **Demographic Breakdown**  
| Category       | Distribution |  
|----------------|-------------|  
| **Gender**     | 65% Male, 35% Female |  
| **Class**      | 55% 3rd, 24% 1st, 21% 2nd |  
| **Embarkation**| 72% Southampton ('S'), 19% Cherbourg ('C'), 9% Queenstown ('Q') |

## **3. Key Insights & Visualizations**  

### **3.1 Survival Drivers**  
#### **A. Gender & Class Interaction**  
![Survival by Gender/Class](download.png)  
- **Females:** 74% survival (vs. 19% males)  
  - *1st-class females:* **>90% survival**  
  - *3rd-class males:* **<20% survival**  
- **Class Hierarchy:**  
  - 1st: 63% | 2nd: 47% | 3rd: 24%  

**Observation:** Gender was a stronger predictor than class, but combined analysis reveals stark disparities (e.g., 1st-class males still outperformed 3rd-class females).  

#### **B. Age & Survival**  
![Age Distribution](download.png)  
- **Children (<10):** 59% survival (*"Women and children first"*)  
- **Peak Mortality:** Ages 20–30 (predominantly male laborers in 3rd class)  
- **Elderly (>60):** 34% survival  

**Actionable Insight:** Age-based policies were partially effective but biased toward higher classes.

### **3.2 Economic Factors**  
#### **A. Fare Distribution**  
![Fare vs. Survival](download.png)  
- **Median Fare:**  
  - Survivors: **£48** | Non-survivors: **£22**  
- **Outliers:** Luxury fares (>£500) had 100% survival.  

**Correlation:** Fare and Pclass (-0.55) confirm class privilege.  

#### **B. Embarkation Port**  
| Port       | Survival Rate |  
|------------|--------------|  
| Cherbourg ('C') | 55% |  
| Southampton ('S') | 34% |  
| Queenstown ('Q') | 39% |  

**Hypothesis:** Cherbourg passengers were wealthier (more 1st-class).  

---

### **3.3 Family Dynamics**  
- **Optimal Family Size:** 2–4 members (**52% survival**)  
- **Singles/Large Families:** Worse outcomes (**<30% survival**)  
- **SibSp/Parch:** Weak but positive correlation with survival (0.08–0.22).  

---

## **4. Advanced Findings**  
### **4.1 Correlation Matrix**  
![Heatmap](download.png)  
- **Strongest Links:**  
  - **Pclass → Fare (-0.55)**  
  - **Pclass → Survival (-0.34)**  
  - **Fare → Survival (0.26)**  
- **Unexpected:** Age showed minimal direct impact (-0.08).  

### **4.2 Class-Specific Trends**  
- **1st Class:** Older passengers (avg. 38 yrs), higher fare variability.  
- **3rd Class:** Younger (avg. 25 yrs), concentrated low fares.  

---

## **5. Conclusions & Recommendations**  
### **5.1 Summary of Findings**  
1. **Gender & Class Bias:** Survival heavily favored females and elites.  
2. **Economic Inequality:** Fare and class were critical determinants.  
3. **Age Paradox:** Children benefited, but young adults suffered disproportionately.
